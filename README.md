# Checkio-Solutions
My perosnal notes and solutions for Checkio tasks

# First Word Simplified
Apparently the quickest way to find the first word in this exercise is not to use `.split()` method but to find the index of the space symbol `str.find(" ")`.
# Number Length
Why on Earth have I decided to make a list ofintegers out of a number, when I can just calculate the length of `str(number)` ?
